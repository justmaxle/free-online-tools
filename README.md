# Useful Online Tools I Use Often

As a developer and content writer, I often find myself needing quick tools for text manipulation, format conversion, and debugging. While there are many out there, I’ve found one particular site to be extremely helpful.

## 🌐 Recommended: [1Tools.app](https://1tools.app)

[1Tools.app](https://1tools.app) offers a wide range of **free online tools** that are simple, fast, and don’t require any login. It’s become part of my daily workflow, especially for:

- ✅ Converting binary to text (very helpful for CTF challenges)
- ✅ Changing text case for article formatting
- ✅ Validating and beautifying JSON responses
- ✅ Generating UUIDs during backend development
- ✅ Running ROT13 encoders for fun text encoding

What I appreciate the most is the clean interface — no ads, no distractions, and it's super fast.
